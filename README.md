# Modded Minecraft Block Mapping

This project maps modded Minecraft blocks to their closest vanilla Minecraft counterparts using cosine similarity in the text embedding space. By leveraging the `nomic-embed-text` model, it enables the use of schematic files containing modded blocks by converting them to vanilla blocks when loading the palette. This is particularly useful for compatibility with vanilla Minecraft environments.

Currently, the project includes **9,663 mappings** and continues to grow as more modded blocks are processed.

## Features
- Maps modded blocks to vanilla blocks using text embeddings and cosine similarity.
- Processes error logs from [mc-structure-processor](https://github.com/Kingburrito777/mc-structure-processor) to identify unknown modded blocks.
- Outputs mappings to a CSV file (`modded_block_map_full.csv`) for easy integration.
- Utilizes the `nomic-embed-text` model, which outperforms other embedding models like BERT for this task.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `scikit-learn` (for cosine similarity calculations)
- `ollama` (to run the `nomic-embed-text` model locally)
- Error log file (`error_log_unknown_blocks.txt`) generated by [mc-structure-processor](https://github.com/Kingburrito777/mc-structure-processor)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/modded-block-mapping.git
   cd modded-block-mapping
   ```
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn ollama
   ```
3. Set up Ollama and ensure the `nomic-embed-text` model is available:
   ```bash
   ollama pull nomic-embed-text
   ```
   Ensure the Ollama server is running locally at `http://localhost:11434`.

## Usage
1. Prepare the error log file (`error_log_unknown_blocks.txt`) containing unknown modded blocks, formatted as:
   ```
   Unknown block: swdm:siding_light_green_stairs
   Unknown block: swdm:roof_tile_lime_legacy
   ...
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. The script will:
   - Load vanilla blocks from `block_mapping/blocks.json`.
   - Extract modded blocks from the error log.
   - Compute embeddings using `nomic-embed-text`.
   - Map modded blocks to their nearest vanilla counterparts.
   - Save the mappings to `block_mapping/modded_block_map_full.csv`.

## Example Mappings
Below are some notable mappings from the generated CSV:

| Modded Block                          | Vanilla Block             |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| pixelmon:bauxite_ore                  | coal_ore                  |
| harvestcraft:salt                     | sand                      |
| ThermalFoundation:Ore                 | gold_ore                  |
| pixelmon:white_chair                  | white_bed                 |
| biomesoplenty:log_0                   | jungle_log                |
| biomesoplenty:fir_fence               | spruce_fence              |
| appliedenergistics2:quantum_ring      | bell                      |
| cocricotmod:condiment_ketchup         | kelp                      |
| victorymod:bug_jar                    | bee_nest                  |
| ktmod:server_rack_5                   | vault                     |

### Questionable Mappings
Due to complex or ambiguous modded block names, some mappings may be less accurate:

| Modded Block                          | Vanilla Block             |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| victorymod:paint_four_fifteen         | chiseled_nether_bricks    |
| victorymod:high_chair                 | tall_grass                |
| victorymod:backpack                   | jungle_log                |
| victorymod:rich_cup_one               | pumpkin                   |
| pfm:deepslate_tile_kitchen_counter_oven | deepslate_tile_stairs   |

## Limitations
- **Loss of Contextual Data**: Mapping modded blocks to vanilla blocks inherently reduces the block set, potentially losing unique properties of modded blocks.
- **Complex Names**: Modded blocks with highly specific or ambiguous names may result in suboptimal mappings.
- **Dependency on Error Logs**: The script relies on error logs from [mc-structure-processor](https://github.com/Kingburrito777/mc-structure-processor) to identify modded blocks.

## Why `nomic-embed-text`?
The `nomic-embed-text` model was chosen for its superior performance in capturing semantic relationships between block names compared to other models like BERT. Its embeddings provide more accurate cosine similarity results for this specific use case.
